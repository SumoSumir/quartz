It is the holy grail for client side web application security. A strong policy can provide monumental protection against threats such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), Click-jacking, HTTP Downgrade attacks and much more. This is because CSP employs the hardened security framework of the modern browser, baking it into the end users' web application.\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHowever,\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e \n\nthe resilience of CSP is often compromised during web development due to numerous gaps introduced by developers to support certain libraries/inline scripts/quick integrations etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## Learning from Common Mistakes:\n```yaml {title=\"Example of an insecure CSP\"}\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self’ \u003csource\u003e *; \nframe-src http://3rdparty.site \u003csource\u003e; \nscript-src *.google.com:80 \u003csource\u003e cdn.js unsafe-inline unsafe-eval;\n```\n[Not sure what frame-src or any other directives are ? - Click here](https://web.dev/csp/#policy-applies-to-a-wide-variety-of-resources)\n\n### \u003ccode\u003e Insecure default-src: \u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the policy the browser must refer to in case there is no specific one mentioned for its use i.e the default case.\nHere although the scope of the default-src mentions 'self' (allowing only one's own website as the scope), the presence of '*' directs the browser to accept sources from anywhere. The use of such a broad scope can be very dangerous.\n\n### \u003ccode\u003e Lack of font-src, img-src, connect-src, media-src \u0026 more: \u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese additional policies have not been mentioned hence default-src would be used. Making the job of tightening the security of default-src paramount. The above policies are used in case you wish to make an exception for a particular src such as img-src, but don’t want to weaken the security of the default/other configurations. \n\n### \u003ccode\u003e Defining your \\\u003csource\\\u003e: \u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n##### 1. Define strict scope even for reputed first party sites\n- The use of *.google.com allows all of Google's [1120+ subdomains](https://gist.github.com/abuvanth/b9fcbaf7c77c2954f96c6e556138ffe8) to be used as a script source. You may still think of it as not a threat, but just to refresh your memory: Anyone can build a website on sites.google.com and it would fulfill the above regex requirements.\n \n##### 2. Be sure about adding 3rd party websites to your CSP\n- In case there is any vulnerability present in the 3rd party website, it could lead to an attack vector into your site as well.\n\n##### 3. Always think twice when adding '*' to a CSP regex:\n- The sources used in CSP must be precisely defined. Eg if you're accepting a legitimate javascript file from a CDN such as cdn.js, your source should not be cdn.js/* . This is problematic as many public cdn’s allow users to host their own javascript libraries. So an attacker could take advantage of the lax regex and call cdn.js/their-malicious.js. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n### \u003ccode\u003eAvoid 'unsafe-eval'/'unsafe-inline'/'unsafe-hashes' \u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUsing these in any directive is a HUGE risk and must be avoided. Instead move inline scripts into separate javascript files or use a [nonce/hash value](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html#hashes)\n\n## Recommendation: \nIf Content Security Policy is not already present - implement it immediately. Content Security Policy can be set either in the response header or in the html's meta tag, the prior being given a higher priority. \u003cbr\u003e\n```yaml {title=\"Example of a Secure CSP\"}\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self’; \nframe-src 'self'; \nscript-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/core@1.2.1;\nframe-ancestors ‘none’;\nreport-to csp-error;\nreport-uri https://sumirbroota.com/csp-violations\nupgrade-insecure-requests;\n```\n\n### \u003ccode\u003eframe-ancestors ‘none’: \u003c/code\u003e\nThis is a suitable setting in case one is not using an iframe in their sites functionality. frame-ancestors restricts the URLs that can embed the requested resource inside of \\\u003cframe\\\u003e, \\\u003ciframe\\\u003e, \\\u003cobject\\\u003e, \\\u003cembed\\\u003e, or \\\u003capplet\\\u003e elements.\n- If this directive is specified in a \\\u003cmeta\\\u003e tag, the directive is ignored.\n- This directive doesn't fallback to default-src directive.\n- X-Frame-Options is rendered obsolete by this directive and is ignored by the user agents.\n\n### \u003ccode\u003eupgrade-insecure-requests: \u003c/code\u003e\nThe following directive will ensure that all requests will be sent over HTTPS with no fallback to HTTP\n### \u003ccode\u003e report-to: \u003c/code\u003e\nReporting directives delivers violations of prevented behaviors to specified locations. To ensure backwards compatibility report-uri is also used.\n```yaml {title=\"Example Report-To header\"}\nReport-To: {\"group\":\"csp-error\",\"max_age\":180000,\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https://sumirbroota.com/csp-violations\"}],\"include_subdomains\":true}\n```\n\n\u003e[!tldr]\n\u003e1. Be cautious of 3rd party urls \u0026 using '*' in even in trusted urls, if a direct url can be used, it would be best.\n\u003e2. Do not use 'unsafe-eval'/'unsafe-inline'/'unsafe-hashes' instead use a [nonce or a hash value](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html#hashes).\n\u003e3. default-src directive defines the default policy for fetching resources hence make sure it is the most secure.\n\u003e4. Use other source directives if you wish to make an exception for a specific one but no weaken the security of the others/default\n\u003e5. Avoid using the 'data' scheme as it can be used as a vector for XSS.\n\n## Language/Framework Specific Examples:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n```yaml {title=\"For Apache use:\"}\nHeader always set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self';\"\n```\nin your /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/example.conf file. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n```yaml {title=\"For Nginx use:\"}\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy: \"default-src 'self’;\"; always;\n```\nin your server {} block of the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.conf file. Here the always; option specifies to send the CSP no matter the response code. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUse tools such as [SeeSPee](https://github.com/papandreou/seespee) to create a Content-Security-Policy for a website based on the statically detectable relations. *Note you will still have to validate it yourself*\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003csection id=\"tldr\"\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003e [!quote] TLDR;\n\u003e\n\u003e Content Security Policy (CSP) provides mechanisms to websites to restrict content that browsers will be allowed to load e.g. inline scripts, remote javascript files. CSP can be set either in the response header or in the html’s meta tag, the prior being given a higher priority. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003e Recommendation: \n\u003e1.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-31T05:48:40.596543339Z","tags":["setup"]},"/private/extra/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
