...If you're here you know my name is Sumir Broota. I am a cyber-security penetration tester and I enjoy building and breaking systems. Stick around to learn about [cyber security](/tags/Security) and see what projects I am working on.

UPDATE 09/24:
I really don't update this often - check out my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumir-broota) & [breachforce.net](https://breachforce.net) to see some of the things am up to.
